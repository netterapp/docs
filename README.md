# Netter General Documentation
## Aims:
- Set out internal working processes for making changes to the netter codebase, decision making within netter, and how we work together
- Defining the manifesto, and the standards we hold ourselves to as a consequence

### Structure
Divvying up the repo into a few sections:
- **[The netter! manifesto](governance/manifesto.md)**
- **[Organisation process information](organisation-process/)** (Info on how decisions are made internally, and more)
- **[Technical processes](technical-process/)** (How we'll manage technical processes ranging from project inception and handling issues)
- **[Program documentation templating](program-doc-templating/)** (How program documentation should be structured - API docs)
- **[Project documentation templating](project-doc-templating/)** (How project documentation should be structured - at all levels analysis, design)

### Project Tracking
This repo is being tracked w/ an issue on the [main project tracker](https://github.com/orgs/netterapp/projects/1) - new stuff+comments can go somewhere, keep master thread relevant.  

#### Endnote
This guidance here isn't exhaustative and is always subject to change, and there is a high likelihood of this given the potential to move to astro as a web-based markdown interpreter.
