# Netter General Documentation
## Aims:
- Set out internal working processes for making changes to the netter codebase, decision making within netter, and how we work together
- Defining the manifesto, and the standards we hold ourselves to as a consequence

### Structure
Divvying up the repo into a few sections:
- **[The netter! manifesto](governance/manifesto.md)**
- **[Governance](governance/readme.md)**

#### Endnote
This guidance here isn't exhaustative and is always subject to change, and there is a high likelihood of this given the potential to move to astro as a web-based markdown interpreter.
