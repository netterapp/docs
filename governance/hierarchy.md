# Hierarchy

**netter aims to allow collaborators to have near full autonomy over the projects that are being worked on internally - here are guidelines to hierarchy to regulate structure within netter.**  

All contributors to netter are equal, bar a few senior members, and have autonomy over what they do following the project guidelines, where they can start their own projects or contribute to other projects  
In the event of serious deadlocks or disagreements, these concerns should be forwarded to an external mediator - either the current "senior" members of netter, or an independent party, at the discretion of the complainee
