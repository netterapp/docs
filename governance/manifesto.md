# The Netter Manifesto  

> At netter, we believe that the existing practices in software development are fundamentally flawed, and basic rights and protections of people contributing to and using software are in many cases disregarded at the behest of suits or callous entrepreneurs.  
> By setting in stone what we believe in, we hope to make better software that benefits all, without being deceptive or manipulative and to lie a foundation for which we operate.

## Privacy

All users of our systems are afforded the right to absolute privacy, and should never have to compromise on that. Netter will never misuse user data, and any changes we make to the use or processing of user data will be consulted for and require explicit agreement from users affected, as opposed to a hidden privacy policy change with implicit agreement.

## Security

Netter software must be designed and implemented in a secure manner, so that all data that we are responsible for is secure and can only be accessed by the correct parties. Whenever a new feature is in development, consideration must be made to safeguard the integrity of the system that is being built upon. Security issues are our top priority.

## Users

Users are central to the success of any software we make, and maintaining a healthy relationship between users and the solutions we develop is essential. Users must be treated with respect and 

## Open-Source

Netter software, where possible, should be open-source, licensed under the ***[license of choice]*** license. We want to develop solutions that can be built upon by others and actively promote the augmentation and improvement of our tools. Contributions to any software we make, however insignificant or great, is something all users should do, and we hope to be a stepping stone in your programming journey.

## Transparency

Netter strives to be as transparent as possible. Where beneficial to all - users, developers and such, information should be made public. This helps us build trust with all groups of people who interact with us and maintain accountability for our actions. It also makes understanding our decisions and motivations easy to understand, eliminating points of confusion and doubt.

## Conclusion

We hope that **The Netter Manifesto** makes clear the founding principles by which we, and those who work with us, operate. We expect people who work with us to abide by these principles and in doing so, support users to the best of our capabilities, and assist in promoting a healthy working culture.
